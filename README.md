This is a Card Game I prepared for the course Introduction to Python (DSC-20, UCSD). The aim of this project was to teach the fundamentals of OOP to students, using Python. The starter_code folder includes the code given to the students. They were expected to fill in the classes such that all doctests in the Doctests.py class passed. The files in the main folder are the solutions. 

Overall, the game is a variant of classical 52-Deck games, where cards with higher values win. There are many twists on the original formula, which are explained in detail in the writeup. There are many inside jokes as each card is meant to be someone from the class. The humor might be lost on the reader, but the detail is still there.

Use the following command to run the doctests:

python3 -m doctest Doctests.py

No output means all doctests were passed.
